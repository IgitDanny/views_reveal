Extract the Reveal.js library to $base_url/sites/all(OR sitename)/libraries/reveal\r\n2. Enable the Views Reveal module and its dependencies (Libraries, Views, DraggableViews).\r\n3. Navigate to `/admin/structure/views/view/reveal_presentation/edit` and add/edit/remove parameters.\r\n\r\n## -OR-\r\n\r\n### Setup from Scratch\r\n\r\n1. Create a new View Page display:\r\n- Page title: Title of your presentation\r\n\r\n- Path: Whatever\r\n\r\n- Display format: [Reveal Presentation] of [fields] [without links] [without comments]- \r\nI prefer these settings and adding fields as needed, but you can really use \r\nwhatever content display you like, as long as it is a [Reveal Presentation]\r\n\r\n- Items to display: NULL (as in leave empty - this will display all items)\r\n\r\n- *Do not* Use a pager\r\n\r\n- At this point the presentation is basically functional.\r\nSave & exit or Continue & edit the View.\r\n\r\n2. Filter the content by whatever criteria you like- taxonomy terms are an easy\r\nway to flag content for inclusion in the presentation, but you can use whatever\r\nfiltering method you prefer (Contextual, Content type, etc.) to include content\r\nin the presentation.\r\n\r\n- The content preview is useful for seeing the content that will be displayed,\r\nbut to view the presentation you must navigate to the page path.\r\n\r\n3. Change the FORMAT Settings (set the theme, transitions, etc.) of the Reveal\r\nPresentation. Or don't if you like the default settings- do what you want, it's\r\nyour show =)\r\n\r\n- Your site theme may interfere with the reveal.js presentation style. If that\r\nhappens check the <body> styles and override them as needed.\r\n\r\n4. After the content has been filtered and formatted, You should probably Save\r\nthe View ...\r\n\r\n5. Navigate to the page path to view your presentation. Present. Enjoy!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
